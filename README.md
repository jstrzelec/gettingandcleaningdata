script to create tidy data set from study 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
 
the raw text files representing the data set are space-delimited text files
  - 'feature labels' of data collected (mean, std, max, ...)
  - 'activity labels' (walking, running, ...) that correspond with activity codes 
  - separate text files for data for 'test' and 'trial' study subjects (30 total subjects)
  - separate text files listing 'activity' and 'subject' for each data record

this script reads the data records files, and for each,
cbind()'s the 'activity' (code) and 'subject' for each data record
 
those two data frames are then put into a single data frame,
human-readable activity labels are added as a new column,
and then a subset of columns is taken (just mean and std features)

finally a mean summary is produced, grouped by subject and activity



here are column names for first tidy data set produced by script
